```bash
tnr scp <source> <destination>
```

Prefix a path with `instance_id:` to indicate it's remote.

```bash
# Upload: local → remote
tnr scp ./data.csv 0:/home/user/

# Download: remote → local
tnr scp 0:/home/user/results.csv ./
```

<Info>
  Directories are transferred recursively. SSH keys and `~/` expansion are handled automatically.

## Best Practices

- **Compress large transfers**: Zip files before transferring to reduce time
- **Use cloud storage for big files**: For datasets over a few GB, upload to cloud storage and download directly to your instance
